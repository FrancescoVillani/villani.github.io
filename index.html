          <h1>Biosketch</h1>
          <p><strong>Francesco Villani</strong>, born in February 1999, is a PhD student at the University of Genoa, Italy, and a member of the <a href="https://www.saiferlab.ai/people/francescovillani">SAIfer Lab</a>.</p>

          <p>He was born in Venice (VE) in 1999 and obtained his BSc in Computer Science at Ca’ Foscari University of Venice with a thesis on queueing theory and stochastic simulations.</p>

          <p>At Ca’ Foscari he also earned his MSc in “Computer Science – Data Management and Analytics”, with a thesis focusing on the robustness of machine learning models.</p>

          <p>Currently, he is pursuing a Ph.D. in Cybersecurity and Reliable AI at the University of Genoa, where his research mainly focuses on the security and robustness of machine learning systems.</p>

      
      
      
          <h3>Research Interests</h3>
          <p>Francesco Villani’s research is focused on two main fronts:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Machine Learning Security and Reliability:</strong> Francesco started his research in this field with his Master's thesis, where he investigated the adversarial robustness of deep neural networks under sparse evasion attacks. His work focused on evaluating model vulnerabilities beyond the commonly studied ℓ<sub>2</sub> and ℓ<sub>∞</sub> settings, exploring instead the challenges of crafting sparse adversarial perturbations under ℓ<sub>0</sub>-norm constraints. As of now he is continuing his research to improve the robustness of both unsupervised and supervised machine learning models against malicious actors.</li>

            <li><strong>Shortcut Learning in Language Models:</strong> Francesco is interested in understanding how language models rely on superficial cues or spurious correlations—known as shortcuts—when performing seemingly complex tasks. His research aims to identify, analyze, and mitigate these behaviors to promote more robust and generalizable language understanding. This line of work involves evaluating models under distribution shifts, probing their internal representations, and designing interventions that encourage deeper, more semantic learning.</li>
